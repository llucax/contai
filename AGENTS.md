# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working in the contai repository.

## Project Overview

contai is a Docker-based sandbox for running AI CLI tools (OpenCode, GitHub Copilot,
OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, Claude Code, RTK) in isolation. It's a minimal project
with shell scripts and a Dockerfile - no package.json, no TypeScript, no complex build
system.

Read README.md for complete project documentation including features and usage.

## Build Commands

| Command      | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `./build.sh` | Builds `contai:latest` and `contai-github-mcp:latest`    |
| `./contai`   | Runs the container with current directory mounted        |

### Building the Container

```sh
./build.sh
```

The build script passes host UID/GID to ensure proper file permissions inside the container.

It also builds the optional `contai-github-mcp:latest` sidecar image (the
isolated GitHub MCP server). Set `build_mcp=false` in `build.sh` to skip it.

### Running the Container

```sh
./contai opencode    # Run a specific AI tool
./contai             # Start container shell
```

## Testing

This project has no test suite. Changes should be verified by:
1. Building the container: `./build.sh`
2. Running the container and testing functionality: `./contai`
3. Verifying the AI tools work: `./contai opencode --version`
4. Verifying Claude Code is available to the mapped user: `./contai claude --version`
5. Verifying binary-installed tools work: `./contai rtk --version`
6. Verifying RTK bootstrap writes the expected runtime config for shipped tools
7. Verifying the GitHub MCP sidecar starts when a PAT is available
   (`contai-mcp status`) and that `./contai` joins the `contai-net` network

## Linting

No project-level linting is configured. However, the container includes these tools:
- Shell: `shellcheck`, `shfmt`
- Python: `ruff`, `flake8`, `pylint`, `mypy`, `black`, `isort`

To lint shell scripts locally (if shellcheck is installed):
```sh
shellcheck build.sh contai contai-bootstrap contai-mcp
shfmt -d build.sh contai contai-bootstrap contai-mcp
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Shell Scripts

All shell scripts in this project follow these conventions:

#### Shebang and Error Handling
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
```
- Prefer `#!/bin/sh` (POSIX shell): these scripts run on the host, before
  the container exists, so the fewer things they need the better
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` only when a script genuinely needs bash, and say
  why. `contai` does, for arrays: it builds lists of arguments of unknown
  length and has to keep every element quoted, which POSIX `sh` cannot express
  without either `eval` or juggling the positional parameters. Prefer `env`
  over `#!/bin/bash`, as bash is not at that path everywhere, and list the
  requirement in the README
- Always include `set -eu` immediately after the shebang
  - `-e`: Exit immediately on command failure
  - `-u`: Treat unset variables as errors
  - with bash, expand an array that may be empty as `"${a[@]+"${a[@]}"}"`.
    Plain `"${a[@]}"` is an unbound variable error under `-u` before bash
    4.4, and macOS still ships bash 3.2 as `/bin/bash`

#### Variable Naming
- Use lowercase with underscores: `data_dir`, `home_dir`, `env_file`
- Never use camelCase or UPPER_CASE for local variables

#### Quoting
- Always quote variables in strings: `"$home_dir"`
- Use double quotes for strings containing variables
- Single quotes for literal strings without variables

#### Command Substitution
- Use `$(command)` syntax, not backticks
- Example: `$(id -u)`, `$(basename "$0")`

#### Conditionals
- Use `test` command or `[` for conditions: `if test "$tool" = "contai"`
- Use `=` for string comparison, not `==`

#### Indentation
- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces
- Indent continuation lines in multi-line commands

#### Line Continuation
- Use backslash `\` for multi-line commands
- Place backslash at end of line with no trailing whitespace

#### Example Shell Script Pattern
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

# Variables
data_dir=~/.local/share/contai
home_dir=$data_dir/home
container_home=$HOME

# Conditionals
if test -d "$home_dir"
then
	echo "Directory exists"
fi

# Multi-line commands
docker run \
	--rm \
	-it \
	-v "$home_dir:$container_home" \
	contai:latest
```

### Dockerfile

#### Base Image
- Use explicit Ubuntu version: `ubuntu:25.10`
- Never use `ubuntu:latest` - specify version number
- Update version when new Ubuntu releases are available

#### Build Arguments
```dockerfile
ARG UBUNTU_VERSION=25.10
ARG UID
ARG USERNAME
ARG GID
ARG GROUPNAME
ARG HOME_DIR
```
- Use ARG for build-time configuration
- Always support UID/GID mapping for host compatibility

The container home is the host's home directory, passed in as the `HOME_DIR`
build argument and defaulting to `$HOME` in `build.sh`. It has to be the same
path in three places, or state written below it is silently lost when the
container exits: the account's home in `useradd`, `ENV HOME`, and the volume
destination in `contai`. Derive it from `$HOME` in the runner rather than
repeating a literal, and keep `$HOME/.local/bin` on `PATH` for tools installed
there by `pkgx`.

Resist replacing it with a fixed path such as `/home/contai`. It looks tidier
and is one less build argument, but it makes an absolute path mean two
different things on the two sides of the mount, and it invalidates the
absolute paths that existing persistent homes already record: `nix` profile
symlinks, virtualenv interpreters, and the project lists that the AI tools
keep in their own configuration.

#### RUN Commands
- Chain related commands with `&&` in single RUN layers
- Use backslash `\` for line continuation
- Indent continuation lines with tabs
- Group package installations logically

#### Package Installation Order
1. System packages via `apt-get`
2. Python packages via `pip` (with `--break-system-packages`)
3. Node.js setup and npm packages
4. Binary downloads and installations

Claude Code should use the system-wide npm package in the image. The native
installer writes its launcher below `$HOME/.local/bin`, which is not a suitable
image-wide location when the image is built as `root`.

#### Example Dockerfile Pattern
```dockerfile
ARG UBUNTU_VERSION=25.10

FROM ubuntu:${UBUNTU_VERSION}

ARG UID
ARG GID

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
	package1 \
	package2 \
	package3

RUN pip install --break-system-packages \
	python-package1 \
	python-package2
```

## Data Directories

The container uses these host directories:
- `~/.local/share/contai/home`: Persistent home directory
- `~/.local/share/contai/env.list`: Environment variables for container
- `~/.local/share/contai/docker-run-opts.list`: Extra `docker run` options, one
  argument per line, appended after contai's own (see README.md)

## GitHub MCP Sidecar

`github-mcp.Dockerfile` builds `contai-github-mcp:latest`, a hardened sidecar
that bridges the official `github-mcp-server` (stdio) to an unauthenticated
Streamable HTTP endpoint via `supergateway`. The host script `contai-mcp`
manages its lifecycle (`up`/`down`/`status`).

Runtime behavior, wired from `contai`:
- `contai` calls `contai-mcp up` on every launch. The sidecar starts only when a
  PAT is retrievable (default: `secret-tool lookup service github-mcp`); no PAT
  means no sidecar and unchanged behavior.
- When the sidecar is running, `contai` attaches the opencode container to the
  private `contai-net` network so it can reach
  `http://contai-github-mcp:8082/mcp`.
- The PAT lives only in the sidecar's environment (passed to Docker by name, not
  value). It never enters `env.list`, the opencode container, argv, or disk.
- The sidecar runs with no host bind mounts, no published ports, `--cap-drop=ALL`,
  `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, read-only rootfs, and pids/memory limits.
- contai ships no opencode configuration; wiring opencode to the MCP and any
  write-gating policy is the user's choice (see README.md).

Knobs: `CONTAI_MCP_PAT_CMD` (lookup command / enable), `CONTAI_MCP_TOOLSETS`
(default `all`), `CONTAI_MCP_READONLY` (set = read-only), and `build_mcp` in
`build.sh`.

## Adding New Features

When modifying this project:

1. **New shell scripts**: Follow the shell style guide above
2. **New Dockerfile layers**: Group related installations, maintain layer efficiency
3. **New AI tools**: Add to the appropriate Dockerfile install section
   (`npm install -g` for npm CLIs, release downloads for shipped binaries)
4. **New system tools**: Add to apt-get install section in Dockerfile
5. **Runtime tool initialization**: Keep startup logic in `contai-bootstrap`
   when it depends on the mounted container home or current project

Automatic RTK initialization always sets `RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1` so it
cannot block on a first-run consent prompt. Users can opt in separately with
`contai rtk telemetry enable` from an interactive container.

**Important**: When making any changes to the project, especially structural changes
(adding/removing files, changing build process, modifying project conventions), update
this AGENTS.md file to reflect those changes.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New AI Tool
1. Determine whether the tool should be installed from npm or release binaries
2. Add it to the matching install section in Dockerfile
3. Rebuild: `./build.sh`
4. Test: `./contai <tool-name>`

### Adding System Packages
1. Add package to `apt-get install -y` section
2. Rebuild and test

### Updating the GitHub MCP Server Version
1. Bump the pinned `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:<tag>` in `github-mcp.Dockerfile`
2. Rebuild: `./build.sh`
3. Recreate the sidecar: `contai-mcp down` (the next `./contai` recreates it)

### Debugging Container Issues
```sh
# Run container interactively
./contai bash

# Check installed tools
./contai which opencode
./contai node --version
```
